            <p>
              Before the pandemic, I was organising events and then I changed my
              career direction and jumped into the digital and IT world. I like
              coding, but also traveling, dancing and reading. But most of all,
              I am fond of my cat. I know, I sound like a clich√©.

              Chatshimi sometimes acts as my rubber-cat-debugging. When I'm
              working remotly, she's constantly by my side and even when she's
              taking a 10-hour power nap, she helps me debugg. Rest assured that
              the code is in safe and capable pawls and hands.
