              My "previous life" was completly different. Events organiser,
              community manager, translator and Front-end developer have few in
              common. There is, however, one consistency in my career path: the
              aim of creating bridges between different parties, using one or
              more communication channels to convey information, and this is
              exactly where I have always put my skills to good use and where my
              strength lies.
